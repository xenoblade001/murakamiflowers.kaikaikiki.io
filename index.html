                            I am releasing Murakami.Flowers in February—the lunar new year—of the Year of the Tiger,
                            2022.<br>
                            There are 12 signs in the Chinese zodiac: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse,
                            sheep,
                            monkey, rooster, dog, and boar. I was born in the Year of the Tiger and this is the fifth
                            time
                            my sign has come around in my life, which means I am 60 years old this year.<br>
                            <br>
                            Murakami.Flowers is the very history of my career as a painter.<br>
                            <br>
                            My background as a painter is as follows.
                            I was a stupid high school student who actually wanted to be a manga or anime creator,
                            because I
                            vaguely liked to draw pictures. But I didn't have any talent in that area, and I wasn’t
                            smart
                            enough to go to a normal university, either, so I decided to go to the art university I
                            could
                            enter just based on a drawing exam. I further chose to study in the Japanese Painting
                            (nihonga)
                            Department because the competition was relatively low among various departments.
                            (Incidentally,
                            the most popular department at the time was Oil Painting, with 65 times more people applying
                            than spots available, so those who passed the exam were treated as geniuses! The Design
                            Department had 55 times more applicants, whereas Japanese Painting had around 25 applicants
                            per
                            spot… Well, it was still a challenge at the time, but the ratio was the lowest among the
                            departments.)<br>
                            <br>
                            Among the painting subjects you study in the nihonga course were "snow, moon, and flowers”,
                            as
                            well as "flowers, birds, wind, and moon”—traditional themes of natural beauty. I personally
                            loved flowers, so I studied a lot about them, which led me to create the paintings of flower
                            characters that you all know today.<br>
                            I was in the world of Japanese historical paintings until I, at age 26, was awakened to the
                            world of Western-style contemporary art. This was at the tail end of the major New Painting
                            (American Neo-Expressionism) boom in New York. So I moved from Tokyo to New York and became
                            a
                            contemporary artist.<br>
                            <br>
                            This time, I'm taking a big step away from the world of New York-style contemporary art and
                            into
                            the world of the metaverse.<br>
                            My awakening to the metaverse happened in the summer of 2020, the first year of the
                            pandemic,
                            when I saw the way my children interact with "Animal Crossing: New Horizons.” One day they
                            were
                            watching some fireworks display within the game while talking on Zoom with their school
                            friends,
                            whom they could no longer meet in person, admiring wholeheartedly how beautiful it was. I
                            saw
                            the reality of the shifting values when I realized that these children could discern beauty
                            within a small video game screen.<br>
                            This experience was similar to the one I had when I first encountered contemporary art at
                            the
                            age of 26, when I was shocked by how there was always a gap between what you saw and the
                            concept, and realized that once I understood the context behind the gap, the artworks took
                            on
                            entirely different appearances. I shuddered with a sensation that made me want to roar in
                            excitement.<br>
                            <br>
                            And riding on the momentum of that sensation, on March 31, 2021, I started to release 108
                            images
                            called Murakami.Flowers on OpenSea. As I learned more about the NFT world, however, I
                            realized
                            that I was totally unprepared and withdrew the sales on April 11. Although I didn't actually
                            sell any NFT then, as a result of this action I have since received a number of invitations
                            to
                            participate in auctions and new NFT projects, and I declined almost all of them.<br>
                            The reason was that it seemed as though the interests in the NFT art at auctions were
                            concentrated only on the numbers game, and I found myself also overly concerned about the
                            market
                            trends than about NFT's creative potential. So I decided to first take a deep breath and
                            cool my
                            head down.<br>
                            <br>
                            Then, I received a really casual invitation from RTFKT to collaborate. I felt that I could
                            learn
                            a lot about metaverse from these young people. I also thought that their genuine love for
                            sneakers was something I could trust, so I accepted their invitation.<br>
                            In the meantime, my company has been developing a handheld Tamagotchi-style game to immerse
                            ourselves in the world of games, and we have also been preparing our own smart contract for
                            Murakami.Flowers.<br>
                            Clone X project with RTFKT was released in December 2021, and at the moment I'm still amazed
                            at
                            the magnitude of reaction it generated.<br>
                            <br>
                            In this essay, rather than explain the contents of my project, I wrote about my initial
                            motivation for entering this space. I plan to write more essays about the project itself
                            going
                            forward, so please keep an eye out for them.<br>
